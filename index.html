          <h2>Reading and Literacy</h2>

          <p>It's amazing how society decided to teach kids reading as the first intellectual skill ðŸ“–âœ¨</p>

            <ul>
              <li>I've been reading since age 6-7, like most of you? </li>
              <li>Every country has an education system and teaches reading methodically.</li>
              <li>99% rate. What's the functional rate? Twitter and job interviews kind of upset me.</li>
              <li>But I digress, that's a topic for another talk.</li>

            Tapes, vinyl etc. are hard to use!
